# b3Dv

This package is meant to easily plot functions over 3D surfaces and point clouds.
It is built on top of the [Blender Python API](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/index.html),
as such it is only compatible with the Python version that Blender uses.
This limitation is due to the bpy package that is used to interact with Blender.
To check which Python version to use see the requirements of [bpy at PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/bpy/).
